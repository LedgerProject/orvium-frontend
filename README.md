# orvium-frontend

This is the frontend application for Orvium project.

This version corresponds to the LEDGER deliverable Prototype #2. In this version, the application uses the Orvium backend to interact and persist data.

If you want to use the application without the backend dependency, it is always possible to reimplement the application services (files `.service.ts`) and mockup data interaction.

## Install dependencies

You need node and npm available in your system to run this code.
We recommend using something like [Node Version Manager](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm).

Run `npm i` to install the project dependencies.


## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.


## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.


## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Test

Run `ng test` to run tests.
